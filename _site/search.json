    "section": "Course overview",
    "text": "Course overview\nThe development and diffusion of sustainable innovations, cooperation for sustainable resource management, and political polarization that can undermine these, share a common explanation: these phenomena all emerge from repeated social interactions between individuals over time. These interactions take the form of social learning, social influence, or strategic economic cooperation.\nTake this course to learn how to develop computational “experiments” of repeated social interaction that can be used to design more effective sustainability interventions and to analyze behavioral data. Students will learn transferrable technical skills in programming and mathematics. Students will deepen their interdisciplinary understanding of the social and behavioral sciences. With these skills and understanding, students will be empowered to create research products that analyze and evaluate potential sustainability interventions using computation.\n\nLearning goals\nThrough participation in lecture and lab sections and completion of course activities, students will\n\nlearn modern approaches to scientific modeling and statistical analysis of social behavior\nlearn to develop, implement, and analyze their own models for designing sustainability interventions\nlearn to write effective research papers using the Introduction, Model, Analysis, Discussion structure\nimprove their R programming skills, including the popular tidyverse, for simulation modeling and data science see the R for Data Science book for more details.\n\n\n\nExpectations\nUnderstanding mutual expectations can help everyone succeed. There are things you can expect of me and things I expect of enrolled students.\n\nWhat you can expect of me\nI will do my best to promote an encouraging, safe, and fair learning environment to promote student success. I will strive to understand and support student career goals coming from a diversity of life experiences.\nYou can expect I will be eager to help when needed, especially if you start from very little to no experience with math and programming. I understand that these subjects can cause anxiety for some.\n\n\nExpectations of all students\nStudents are expected attend all scheduled course meetings unless there are extenuating circumstances. Please email if this occurs. Students are expected to seek help if they are struggling or stuck.\n\n\nExpectations of graduate students\nGraduate students will be required to complete an extra exercise on each problem set that will be extra credit for undergraduates. They will be held to higher standards for clarity, structure, and technical detail in midterm and final projects.\n\n\nHonor code\nYou are expected to cite sources and individuals from whom you have learned and borrowed ideas as a display of academic, intellectual, and creative integrity. Failure to do so is a violation of Stanford’s Honor Code and is a serious offense, even when the violation is unintentional. Conduct prohibited by the Honor Code includes all forms of academic dishonesty, among them unpermitted collaboration and representing others’ work as one’s own. Please review the policies and guidance from the Office of Community Standards, and documentation and citation resources from the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking.\n\n\n\nCourse materials\nStudents will need a laptop or otherwise portable computer to bring to the Wednesday lab sections. There are a number of readings from journals and books (see the Calendar below), but these are either available through Stanford Libraries, or if not I will provide PDF copies via Canvas."

Wednesday meetings will focus on developing programming, analysis, and writing skills in an interactive lab-section setting. In these Wednesday sections students will be introduced to problem sets and midterm and final projects, and have time to work together with the instructor and peers.\n\nCoursework and Grading\nStudents will be evaluated based on their completion of six assignments worth 100 points total: four problem sets (10 points each), a midterm project (20 points), and a final project (40 points). Undergraduate students will have the opportunity for bonus points on each problem set.\n\nProblem sets: There will be four problem sets introduced on Wednesdays during the computing lab section. Students will also have the opportunity to work together and ask the instructor questions during other lab sections before each assignment is due. (10 points per problem set)\nMidterm project: Students will write a report on how they will use a model from the course to address a sustainability problem of interest. The midterm project will be used as a foundation for the final project. (20 points)\nFinal project: Students will expand on their midterm project, performing a detailed model analysis and discussing the implications of their results for designing sustainability interventions. (40 points)\n\n\n\nLate coursework policy\nIf there is a family or health emergency or other acute distress please contact me to make arrangements to submit late work without penalty. Otherwise the following policy applies:\n\nProblem sets up to 72 hours late can receive 50% credit.\nProblem sets up to one week late can receive 20% credit.\nThe midterm project may be submitted up to one week late to receive 50% credit.\nThe final project may not be submitted late.\nNo credit will be given for work beyond one week late."

    "text": "Sustainability will only be achieved if people and institutions behave sustainably. This course teaches techniques for predicting the spread of sustainable behaviors, in human social networks. Sustainability, and other pressing issues, needs a rigorous theory of how sustainable behavior spreads. This is apparent since there has been scant real progress towards limiting biodiversity loss, inequality, global warming, and other sustainability targets such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This suggests people, institutions, or organizations continue to behave unsustainably, and begs the question: what will it take to get sustainable behaviors to become widely practiced in different societies? Behaviors are transmitted from person to person through social learning, be it through instruction or observation. Who learns from or observes whom is structured based on who we know, who we live near, who we work with, or whose messages we read on the internet.\nIn this course we want to build on progress towards an empirically-motivated system for decisionmaking when promoting sustainable behavior, like Elinor Ostrom’s socio-ecological systems framework (Ostrom1990?) that identified the following design principles. These principles are written below as re-formulated by Cox, Arnold, and Tomás (2010) who evaluated their effectiveness after two more decades of use:\n\nWell-defined boundaries\nCongruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions\nFair, flexible collective-choice arrangements\nMonitoring and monitors must be reliable and inclusive of local communities\nGraduated sanctions: penalties for non-compliance with sustainable practices should start small and increase with further non-compliance\nAccess to responsive, low-cost conflict-resolution mechanisms\nMinimum recognition of rights of all stakeholders to recognize local ownership of local common-pool resources\nSuccessful common-pool resource management requires nested institutions so those lower in the hierarchy can achieve power parity with those higher by having greater numbers of decision-makers in those foundational decision making groups\n\nThese design principles were inferred and developed by reviewing numerous policy and economic interventions to promote sustainable use of common-pool resources in specific socio-economic systems, both before 1990 and up to 2010 with the update from Cox, Arnold, and Tomás (2010). Among other notable achievements, the design principles helped elevate indigenous and traditional sustainable ecosystem management practices (Nalau et al. 2018), and community-led adaptation more generally (McNamara et al. 2020). For example, vibrant coastal mangrove forests have long been known to support fish populations and protect against storm surges (Pearson, McNamara, and Nunn 2020). To complement these design principles, and other lessons from sustainability practitioners, we want to develop simplified mechanistic models of human sustainability behavior change to identify rigorous principles of information transmission, cooperation, and political organization.\n\n\nIn this course we learn In the coming sections we develop several different models of social behavior for this purpose. The models are always a more specific version of some more general or abstract model. A model here is a simplified representation of the world that we can use for science and decision making. One motivation for this course, in fact, is to provide a more scientific way of thinking about social responses to sustainable policy and other interventions, whether or not that thinking is aided by computational, formal, or other modeling. We start from a very abstract model with few details specified so we can identify common elements of social science models and consolidate our theoretical knowledge (Figure 1). This is practically useful for model development and analysis since we can theoretically compartmentalize the behavioral and social assumptions being made in the model. We know where to change assumptions to generate new intervention strategies and generate new scientific hypotheses about social behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The abstract social behavior model used in this course. All models we analyze here are instances of this framework created by specifying how each block works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract model workflow description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a population represented as \\(N\\) nodes in a social network.\nAt each time step, imagine that each individual in a population “selects” or is otherwise paired with another individual, their interaction partner. Each individual may also take independent action. For example, the Legacy-Adaptive model of the diffusion of adaptations in the next section specifies that when one person doing a Legacy behavior observes another doing the Adaptive behavior, the one doing Legacy will switch to Adaptive with probability \\(\\alpha\\). Over the duration of the course, we will consider interactions that consist of learning/adopting behaviors, deciding whether to cooperate with others for collective adaptation, and influencing opinions.\nThis process is repeated over many time steps where each individual does something or interacts with another individual.\nThe conditions for stopping the model, the stopping conditions, must be specified. The simplest stopping condition is to run a simulation for a certain number of time steps. Other options include stopping when the population reaches some form of equilibrium, for example, the number of people doing an adaptive behavior stays relatively constant over several time steps.\nWe observe how certain outcome variables of interest, such as how many people adopt some behavior over time or how long it takes for some fraction of people to adopt an adaptive behavior.\nIn full analyses of these models, we analyze these outcome variables across different hypothetical contexts, such as changing how “viral” (i.e. how likely to be adopted) adaptive behaviors are.\n\n\n\n\nTo use this abstract social model, proceed box by box and decide how the different parts work. To begin, decide what assumptions to make about social network structure, whether there are payoffs, how payoffs may change over time due to environmental shifts, etc. Then one must specify how individuals are paired together to interact, which in the real world could be highly random or constrained by one’s social network. Then all paired individuals interact according to some interaction rule. In the Legacy-Adaptive model introduced below, for example, individuals adopt an adaptive behavior with a certain probability if they are exposed to it.\nDeveloping new models of social behavior, then, amounts to specifying social structure, how people get paired up and interact, and how people decide to update their behavior. The first more specific class of social models we introduce assume that there is an adaptive behavior that can be learned when it is observed, with some probability. These are diffusion of adaptation models. Next, cooperation and coordination models. We close with opinion dynamics models.\nWithin diffusion of adaptation models, we will start with formal models that can give us functions for diffusion that we can easily write down and visually inspect. The cost of this exactness are unrealistic assumptions, including that population sizes approach infinity and partner choice is unconstrained. We will then show why stochastic (i.e., randomized) computational models are essential to sufficiently represent the aleatoric dance of social behavior in order to understand how social outcomes may vary due to chance events, which in general is sensitive to initial conditions. We will continue on to consider more adaptive forms of social learning that blind copying of a neighbor. Then we will analyze models of the cultural evolution of cooperation and coordination, focused on the case of sustainable management of common-pool resources such as groundwater, forests, or fisheries. Finally in this course we will study opinion dynamics models where interactions take the form of persuasion, though we will abstract away nearly all features of rhetoric and focus only on how the opinions of interaction partners affect changes in each partner’s opinions or beliefs.\n\n\n\nSocial networks are at once intuitive, perhaps partly due to their prominence in pop culture, and also technically complex and theoretically deep. Social networks have nodes (aka vertices) that represent people, usually drawn as circles but any shape is ok. Relationships between people are represented by edges, drawn as lines. If the lines have arrowheads, the arrow will point in the direction of information flow, for example from a teacher to her student. If there is no arrow, or two arrows pointing different directions, this indicates a symmetric relationship where information could flow in either direction.\nWe need to know some basic things about social networks because all models make assumptions about them. First, a social network is a theoretical tool, a “cognitive gadget” , that represents relationships between people. Social networks are instances of graphs, an abstract mathematical structure for representing any type of entities and relationships between them. Graph nodes (aka vertices) represent the entities and edges represent the relationships between nodes. Edges are drawn as lines with or without arrows to indicate the flow of information, with information flowing to a learner, or observer more generally, from a teacher or demonstrator (Figure Figure 2). Lines with arrows are called directed edges. For a given pair of individuals, each may sometimes be teacher or learner. This case may be represented by two directed edges pointing opposite directions or a single undirected edge, i.e., a line with no arrowheads (Figure Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Social networks represent relationships between people, with the arrow pointing away from the teacher and at the learner, i.e., in the direction of information flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: If there are two arrows, one pointing at each individual, or a line with no arrowheads, then each member of the dyad may be either teacher or learner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start, consider the following fictional advice network at a startup, Sustainability Intervention Solutions. There are only three team members right now with different roles. Esmeralda, the CEO, advises River and Brook. Esmeralda and Brook left their previous jobs at Hooli to start the company, so Brook also advises Esmeralda. River is the newest member of the team, an expert programmer with little business or sustainability experience, so Esmeralda mentors River. Brook is knowledgable about business and sustainability, but just learning to program, so River is helping Brook develop her skills. We can use a social network to represent this social structure where arrows point from Esmeralda to River and Brook; from River to Brook; and from Brook to Esmeralda.\n\nlibrary(igraph)\nsocnet &lt;- make_graph(~ Esmeralda-+River-+Brook++Esmeralda)\nplot(socnet, layout = layout_in_circle(socnet), edge.curved=0.4, vertex.size = 90)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a year the team have succeeded hiring clients and need another programmer to build an interface to deliver their custom relational databases on corporate sustainability decisions in response to different legislation at the national, state, and local levels. They hire Arun who has some programming expertise and experience in sustainability because he took Matt Turner’s Computational Social Science for Sustainability at Stanford. Still, he has a lot to learn and needs River’s and Esmeralda’s advice.\nAfter a while it is clear they need a computational scientist. They hire Marco, who reports directly to River, whom he asks for help learning about sustainability. Arun asks for programming help from Marco as does Brook. Marco gets input from River and Esmeralda on programming and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular networks are those ones for which all nodes have the same degree. A regular lattice with degree \\(k\\) is useful for constructing networks with the small-world property. We can use code from the socmod.R script in the root directory of the CSS4S-ProblemSets repo to create one with ten nodes, each connected to two neighbors:\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'assertthat'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tibble':\n\n    has_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is one more example, but with 20 nodes connected to six neighbors each:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn social networks, the entities are people and the relationships could be friendships, business partnerships, or, in the case of our first social network example, marriages between powerful families in Florence during the 1400s that elevated the the Medici clan developing into what was essentially one of the world’s first political parties. This follows Jackson’s introductory example in his textbook starting on p. 4 (Jackson 2008). Studying the Medici’s social network gives us our first look at the structure of social influence. During that period, the Medici family rose in wealth and political power over the lifetime of the family patriarch, Cosimo. Starting from a relatively weak position overall in the Florentine oligarchy of the time, Cosimo arranged marriages with other powerful families to subtly amplify the Medici control of politics and markets in Florence (Figure Figure 6; source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netrankr/vignettes/use_case.html). In the Florentine network, the edges are undirected, which makes sense since marriage takes two families and is therefore not directed. Note then we have no knowledge from which family came husband and wife. Note too that there could be multiple marriages between two families, but this information is not contained in this graph.\nIn an undirected graph, the neighborhood of an individual \\(i\\) (or family, organization, institution, or other social entity) can be written \\(n_i\\) and is a set of all the individuals who share an edge with \\(i\\). The set of the Medici’s network neighbors then is written mathematically as\n\\[\nn_{\\text{Medici}} = \\{\\text{Salviati},~\\text{Acciaiuol},~\\text{Barbadori},~\\text{Ridolfi},~\\text{Tornabuon},~\\text{Albizzi}\\}\n\\] The degree of node \\(i\\) is the number of neighbors it has, written \\(k_i\\), so \\(k_\\text{Medici} = 6\\). In the case of directed networks it is common to define in- and out-neighborhoods, referring to arrow direction, which for us correspond to teacher- and learner-neighborhoods.\n\nlibrary(netrankr)  # Has Florentine network data we load next line.\ndata(\"florentine_m\")\n\n# Delete Pucci family (isolated)\nflorentine_m &lt;- delete_vertices(florentine_m, which(degree(florentine_m) == 0))\n\n# plot the graph\nset.seed(111)\nplot(florentine_m,\n  vertex.label.cex = 1,\n  vertex.size = 20,\n  vertex.label.color = \"black\",\n  vertex.color = NODE_COLOR,\n  vertex.frame.color = NODE_COLOR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Florentine marriage network where edges represent marriages between families (node labels).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a bar plot of the degrees for each family:\n\ndeglist &lt;- degree(florentine_m) \n\n# Create a tbl of degrees for each family then barplot using ggplot2.\ntibble(Family=names(deglist), k=as.vector(deglist)) %&gt;%     \n  mutate(Family=fct_reorder(as_factor(Family), k)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=k, y=Family)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=NETWORK_COLOR) +   \n  theme_classic(base_size = 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Degree of each family in Florence intermarriage network.\n\n\n\n\nThe degree distribution is the fraction of nodes having degree \\(k\\), written \\(P(k)\\). Since the Medici family is the only one with a degree of six, and there are fifteen families, \\(P(6)=\\frac{1}{15}\\approx 0.066\\), which we can check like so:\n\ndegdist &lt;- degree_distribution(florentine_m)\nmedici_k &lt;- 6\n\n# Degree distribution starts at 0 and goes to maximum k; index 1, then\n# correlates to k=0 and need to add 1 to the Medici index.\ndegdist[[medici_k + 1]]\n\n[1] 0.06666667\n\n\nWe plot the degree distribution see that the modal \\(k\\) is 3 and that the distribution is somewhat more concentrated in \\(k\\leq3\\) compared to \\(k &gt; 3\\), using the built-in barplot function to plot a simple histogram of \\(P(k)\\) using base R:\n\ndegdist_vec &lt;- as.vector(degdist)\nlibrary(forcats)\nk_vec &lt;- as_factor(0:6)\n\nggplot(tibble(k = k_vec, freq = degdist_vec), aes(x=k_vec, y=degdist_vec)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=NETWORK_COLOR) + xlab(\"Degree, k\") + \n  \n  ylab(\"Frequency, P(k)\") + theme_classic(base_size=22) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Degree distribution shows how frequently nodes (families here) have \\(k\\) edges (marriages).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found one tutorial to follow up on while preparing this, so I created this place to put this tutorial and other resources that may be useful later on.\n\nNetwork Visualizations in R using ggpraph and graphlayouts by David Schoch."

A regular lattice with degree \\(k\\) is useful for constructing networks with the small-world property.

This follows Jackson’s introductory example in his textbook starting on p. 4 (Jackson 2008). Studying the Medici’s social network gives us our first look at the structure of social influence. During that period, the Medici family rose in wealth and political power over the lifetime of the family patriarch, Cosimo. Starting from a relatively weak position overall in the Florentine oligarchy of the time, Cosimo arranged marriages with other powerful families to subtly amplify the Medici control of politics and markets in Florence (Figure Figure 6; source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netrankr/vignettes/use_case.html). In the Florentine network, the edges are undirected, which makes sense since marriage takes two families and is therefore not directed. Note then we have no knowledge from which family came husband and wife. Note too that there could be multiple marriages between two families, but this information is not contained in this graph.\nIn an undirected graph, the neighborhood of an individual \\(i\\) (or family, organization, institution, or other social entity) can be written \\(n_i\\) and is a set of all the individuals who share an edge with \\(i\\). The set of the Medici’s network neighbors then is written mathematically as\n\\[\nn_{\\text{Medici}} = \\{\\text{Salviati},~\\text{Acciaiuol},~\\text{Barbadori},~\\text{Ridolfi},~\\text{Tornabuon},~\\text{Albizzi}\\}\n\\] The degree of node \\(i\\) is the number of neighbors it has, written \\(k_i\\), so \\(k_\\text{Medici} = 6\\). In the case of directed networks it is common to define in- and out-neighborhoods, referring to arrow direction, which for us correspond to teacher- and learner-neighborhoods.\n\nlibrary(netrankr)  # Has Florentine network data we load next line.\ndata(\"florentine_m\")\n\n# Delete Pucci family (isolated)\nflorentine_m &lt;- delete_vertices(florentine_m, which(degree(florentine_m) == 0))\n\n# plot the graph\nset.seed(111)\nplot(florentine_m,\n  vertex.label.cex = 1,\n  vertex.size = 20,\n  vertex.label.color = \"black\",\n  vertex.color = NODE_COLOR,\n  vertex.frame.color = NODE_COLOR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Florentine marriage network where edges represent marriages between families (node labels).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a bar plot of the degrees for each family:\n\ndeglist &lt;- degree(florentine_m) \n\n# Create a tbl of degrees for each family then barplot using ggplot2.\ntibble(Family=names(deglist), k=as.vector(deglist)) %&gt;%     \n  mutate(Family=fct_reorder(as_factor(Family), k)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=k, y=Family)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=NETWORK_COLOR) +   \n  theme_classic(base_size = 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Degree of each family in Florence intermarriage network.\n\n\n\n\nThe degree distribution is the fraction of nodes having degree \\(k\\), written \\(P(k)\\).

    "text": "LA and LAL compartmental “contagion” models\nContagion models like the LA and LAL models assume that when individuals encounter one another there is some probability that some individual-level attribute, in this case whether the individual \\(i\\) does \\(A\\). These models require relatively few parameters and variables, but ignore adaptive strategies people use for acquiring new information (Table 1).\nNamely, these model contain two dynamic outcome variables \\(L_t\\) and \\(A_t\\) if time is discrete (\\(L(T)\\) and \\(A(t)\\) if time is continuous; see Note (note-continuous-time-LA-LAL?)) the number of individuals performing \\(L\\) and the number performing \\(A\\). These outcomes are dynamic, so \\(t\\) represents time, which is discrete in our main treatment of these models, meaning that points in time can be indexed by integers, i.e., time steps are indexed by \\(t_i\\) where \\(i \\in \\{1, 2, 3,\\ldots\\}\\), e.g., \\(t \\in \\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, \\ldots\\}\\) could be discrete time steps for a model with \\(t\\) in months meant to represent some process for which we have data every three months. If time is continuous ((note-continuous-time-LA-LAL?)) then \\(t\\in[0,\\infty)\\). Although time can continue on to infinity, we usually specify that models will stop at some time step or when some condition is met. One of the most important conditions is whether the population has fixated, meaning all agents do the same behavior. Finally, there are two parameters that determine the probability that individuals change their behavioral state (from doing \\(L\\) to doing \\(A\\) or vice-versa). In both the LA and LAL models, the probability \\(A\\) is adopted when an \\(L\\) meets an \\(A\\) is the adoption rate, \\(\\alpha\\). In the LAL model, at every time step, every agent doing \\(A\\) might drop the behavior, i.e., stop doing the behavior, reverting to do \\(L\\) for the next time step. The probability one doing \\(A\\) reverts to \\(L\\) is \\(\\delta\\), the drop rate. So, the LA and LAL models are in fact the same model where we can set \\(\\delta = 0\\) to recover the LA model from the LAL model.\n\n\n\nTable 1: LA and LAL model parameter and variable symbols and definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDescription\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\\(L,L_t,L(t)\\)\nNumber of individuals doing Legacy behavior at time \\(t\\); like \\(A\\) serves as a noun for the behavior itself.\n\\(L_t \\in \\{0,\\ldots,N\\}\\); \\(L(t) \\in [0, \\infty)\\)\n\n\n\\(A,A_t,A(t)\\)\nNumber of individuals doing Adaptive behavior at time \\(t\\), but used interchangeably for the behavior itself, e.g., “an individual doing \\(A\\)”.\n\\(A_t \\in \\{0,\\ldots,N\\}\\), \\(A(t) \\in [0, \\infty)\\)\n\n\n\\(t\\)\nTime, which could be discrete or continuous.

Below we show how to write a function to implement this recursion to calculate a time series and compare the results for two different adoption rates, \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The Legacy-Adaptive model only allows for a change of individual-level state from performing the legacy behavior to performing the adaptive behavior.\n\n\n\n\nla_recursion &lt;- function(N, A0, alpha, tmax) {\n  A_return &lt;- numeric(N+1)  # Create output time series vector.\n  # Set current A_t to be A_0\n  At &lt;- A0\n  A_return[1] &lt;- At\n  # Iterate \n  for (t in 1:tmax) {\n    # Anext is code for A_{t+1}\n    Anext &lt;- At + (alpha * At * (1 - (At/N)))\n    A_return[t+1] &lt;- Anext\n    At &lt;- Anext\n  }\n  return (A_return)\n}\n\n\nN &lt;- 100\nA0 &lt;- 5\nalpha_low &lt;- 0.05\ntmax &lt;- 200\ntvec &lt;- 0:tmax\nAvec_low_alpha &lt;- la_recursion(N, A0, alpha_low, tmax)\n\nalpha_high &lt;- 0.8\nAvec_high_alpha &lt;- la_recursion(N, A0, alpha_high, tmax)\n\nadopt_tbl &lt;- tibble(timestep = rep(tvec, 2), \n                    alpha = \n                      as_factor(c(rep(alpha_low, length(tvec)), \n                                  rep(alpha_high, length(tvec)))),\n                    A = c(Avec_low_alpha, Avec_high_alpha))\n\nggplot(adopt_tbl, aes(x=timestep, y=A, color=alpha)) +\n  geom_line() + theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete change in recursion, continuous (infinitesimal) change in differential equations\nIn the recursion LA model, the change in \\(A\\), \\(\\Delta A\\) from time step \\(t\\) to time step \\(t+1\\) is \\[\n\\Delta A = A_{t+1} - A_t = \\alpha N \\Pr(L,A)\n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\Pr(L,A) = \\frac{L}{N}\\frac{A}{N}\\) is the probability an individual doing \\(L\\) and another doing \\(A\\) interact under the well-mixed assumption.\n\n\n\\(\\cdot\\quad\\) The well-mixed assumption says that everyone in a population is equally likely to interact with one another. This means the probability of someone doing \\(L\\) encountering someone else doing \\(A\\) is the same for all people doing \\(L\\) (or vice-versa).\nPlug this probability in to Equation 1 and cancel an \\(N\\) on top and bottom to get \\[\n\\Delta A = \\frac{\\alpha}{N} L A = \\alpha' L A,\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\alpha' = \\alpha / N\\). Because we use \\(t\\) to label time steps and assumed that time steps are separated by \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), we can multiply the right side of Equation 2 by 1 in the form of \\(\\Delta t\\): \\[\n\\Delta A = \\alpha' LA \\Delta t\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\\(\\cdot\\quad\\)The general probability that a person doing behavior \\(b\\) interacts with a person doing \\(b'\\) (read “b prime”) \\(\\Pr(b,b')\\), i.e. \\(\\Pr(L,A)\\) for legacy-adaptive, \\(\\Pr(L, L)\\) for legacy-legacy, etc.\nCalculus, the foundation of differential equations, is the mathematics of rates of change, which was achieved through the following conceptual leap. In terms of our LA model, calculus works by assuming that \\(\\Delta t\\) becomes “infinitesimally small”, written \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\). Before \\(\\Delta t\\) gets all the way to zero, we calculate \\(\\Delta A\\) over this infinitesimally small \\(\\Delta t\\). This infinitesimal \\(\\Delta t\\) is written \\(dt\\), and the similarly infinitesimal \\(\\Delta A\\) is written \\(dA\\). When \\(\\Delta \\to 0\\), then, we replace \\(\\Delta\\) with \\(d\\) and Equation 3 becomes \\[\ndA = \\alpha' L A dt\n\\] which is more commonly written \\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\alpha' L A dt\n\\tag{4}\\] representing the flow in of people previously doing \\(L\\), with the coupled differential equation for \\(L\\) differing only in sign of the right hand side, representing the flow of people away from doing \\(L\\): \\[\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = - \\alpha' L A dt.\n\\]\nThese equations can be solved by using the same substitution we used in the recursion to get a formula for \\(A_{t+1}\\) that depended only on \\(A_t\\), namely that \\(L = N - A\\), so Equation 4 becomes\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\alpha' A(N - A).\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCalculus tells us that we can rearrange the differnetials like they were any other variable. What we want now is to arrange all \\(A\\) terms to one side of the equation, and all \\(t\\) terms to the other because this allows us to integrate the equation. We want to integrate the equation because this is the calculus procedure that converts rates of change of a variable to the accumulation of that variable. Rearranage Equation 5 to get\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{A(N - A)} = \\alpha' dt.\n\\]\nWe integrate both sides of this equation, which is written\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{dA}{A(N - A)} = \\int \\alpha' dt = \\alpha't + C\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) called a constant of integration that must be determined by initial conditions for this problem, namely the value \\(A(t=0)\\) and we used the fact that \\(\\int a dx = ax + C\\) where \\(a\\) is any constant and \\(x\\) is any dynamic variable. The integral on the left hand side can be integrated formally, i.e., without using a computer, but it’s significantly more complicated. After integrating the left hand side of Equation 6 it is still necessary to solve for \\(A\\) in terms of \\(t\\). See Note 1 for these details.\nAfter all that math we obtain the logistic equation,\n\\[\nA(t) = \\frac{N}{1 + \\frac{N}{A_0}e^{-\\alpha N t}},\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(A_0 = A(t = 0)\\) is the initial condition.\nBritton (2003) explains in Ch. 3, p. 87, this is the same equation as single-species population dynamics in an ecosystem with a carrying capacity, \\(K\\). In this case, \\(K = N\\). See Britton Ch. 3 for even more detail on the family of compartmental susceptible-infected-recovered models that we have adapted for sustainable adaptations in the context of the field of mathematical biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Integration and solution of \\(A(t)\\) from LA differential equations model\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform partial fraction decomposition on \\(\\frac{1}{A (N - A)}\\): \\[\n\\frac{1}{A (N - A)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{A} + \\frac{1}{N - A} \\right).\n\\]\nIntegrate both sides: \\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{A} + \\frac{1}{N - A} \\right) dA = \\int \\alpha \\, dt.\n\\]\nThis yields: \\[\n\\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\ln|A| - \\ln|N - A| \\right) = \\alpha t + C,\n\\] where\\(C\\)is the integration constant.\nSimplify: \\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A}{N - A}\\right) = \\alpha N t + C',\n\\] where \\(C' =  N C\\).\nExponentiate to solve for\\(A\\): \\[\n\\frac{A}{N - A} = e^{\\alpha N t + C'}.\n\\]\nRearranging gives: \\[\nA = \\frac{N}{1 + e^{-C' - \\alpha N t}}.\n\\]\nFinally, rewrite \\(e^{-C'}\\) as a constant \\(K\\): \\[\nA = \\frac{N}{1 + K e^{-\\alpha N t}},\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere \\(K\\) depends on the initial conditions.\nThis is the solution for \\(A(t)\\), and \\(L(t)\\) can be recovered using \\(L(t) = N - A(t)\\).\nTo find \\(K\\) for some initial condition, set \\(t=0\\), call \\(A_0 = A(t=0)\\), and solve for \\(K\\). Note that when \\(t=0\\), the denominator in Equation Equation 8 becomes \\(1 + K\\) since \\(e^0 = 1\\). Then we have\n\\[\nA(0) = \\frac{N}{1 + K}\n\\]\nwhich we can multiply by \\(1 + K\\) on both sides and rearrange to get\n\\[\nK = \\frac{N}{A_0}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy-Adaptive-Legacy (LAL) model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The Legacy-Adaptive-Legacy model also allows for transitions from the state \\(A\\) to state \\(L\\), which occurs with probability \\(\\delta\\).\n\n\n\nWhen considering the total change in \\(A,\\) written \\(\\Delta A,\\) following a discrete time step, \\(\\Delta t\\), from time “now” to time “next”, i.e., from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\), we can drop the indices since all indices are \\(t\\), i.e.,\n\\[\n\\Delta A = \\alpha A (1 - \\frac{A}{N}) - \\delta A.\n\\tag{9}\\]\nIn this model, two new things are possible that were not possible before. First, the adaptation may completely fail to spread. If more people end up dropping the behavior than adopting it early on, there will be no one doing \\(A\\) that someone doing \\(L\\) could copy. Second, in general, everyone will not eventually adopt \\(A\\), at least not all at once, unlike in the LA model. In the LAL model there is an equilibrium \\(A\\), \\(\\hat A\\), that the system reaches with enough time.\n\nWill the adaptation spread?\nWe want to know if the adaptation will diffuse throughout the population in the LA model given just the adoption rate \\(\\alpha\\) and drop rate \\(\\delta\\). Formally, the adaptation diffuses if \\(\\Delta A &gt; 0\\). We can approximate \\(\\Delta A\\) just after its introduction to a population that is mostly doing the legacy behavior and obtain a useful heuristic value to tell use if it will diffuse. When the adaptive behavior is only just being introduced to a relatively large population, we we say that \\(A &lt;&lt; L,N\\), and so \\(1 - \\frac{A}{N} \\approx 0\\), so that Equation 9 becomes\n\\[\n\\Delta A = \\alpha A - \\delta A &gt; 0.\n\\]\nDividing out \\(A\\), rearranging, and dividing by \\(\\delta\\), we find that the adaptation diffuses if\n\\[\nR_0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta} &gt; 1,\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_0\\) is a rather famous measure called the basic reproduction number in epidemiology that predicts whether a new disease will become endemic or not. For us it predicts whether a sustainable adaptation will diffuse and persist in a population.\n\n\nIf an adaptation persists, what will the long-term adoption level be?\nTo know how many people will perform the adaptive behavior after the diffusion of that behavior has stabilized, we need to calculate its equilibrium value. Assuming \\(R_0 &gt; 1\\), the equilibrium number of adopters, \\(\\hat A\\), is defined as the value of \\(A\\) for which \\(\\Delta A = 0\\), i.e., when \\(A\\) remains constant over time:\n\\[\n\\Delta A = 0 = \\alpha \\hat A\\left(1 - \\frac{\\hat A}{N}\\right) - \\delta\n\\hat A.\n\\]\nThis can be re-arranged to find that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hat A}{N} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\alpha}.\n\\]\nSee MSB pp. 96-97 for the steps and Figure 4.9 on p. 97 for a plot of \\(\\Delta A\\) versus \\(A\\) that illustrates and explains how to find \\(\\hat A\\) graphically (MSB uses the epidemiological framing, which means \\(I\\) replaces \\(A\\)."

    "text": "More notes on social networks\nWe need to know some basic things about social networks because all models make assumptions about them. First, a social network is a theoretical tool, a “cognitive gadget” , that represents relationships between people. Social networks are instances of graphs, an abstract mathematical structure for representing any type of entities and relationships between them. Graph nodes (aka vertices) represent the entities and edges represent the relationships between nodes. Edges are drawn as lines with or without arrows to indicate the flow of information, with information flowing to a learner, or observer more generally, from a teacher or demonstrator (Figure Figure 3). Lines with arrows are called directed edges. For a given pair of individuals, each may sometimes be teacher or learner. This case may be represented by two directed edges pointing opposite directions or a single undirected edge, i.e., a line with no arrowheads (Figure Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Social networks represent relationships between people, with the arrow pointing away from the teacher and at the learner, i.e., in the direction of information flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn social networks, the entities are people and the relationships could be friendships, business partnerships, or, in the case of our first social network example, marriages between powerful families in Florence during the 1400s that elevated the the Medici clan developing into what was essentially one of the world’s first political parties. This follows Jackson’s introductory example in his textbook starting on p. 4 (Jackson 2008). Studying the Medici’s social network gives us our first look at the structure of social influence. During that period, the Medici family rose in wealth and political power over the lifetime of the family patriarch, Cosimo. Starting from a relatively weak position overall in the Florentine oligarchy of the time, Cosimo arranged marriages with other powerful families to subtly amplify the Medici control of politics and markets in Florence (Figure Figure 5; source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netrankr/vignettes/use_case.html). Eventually we will explain Cosimo’s strategy, which is not just simply to have the greatest diversity of intermarriages in the group of oligarchs (though the Medicis did). For now, we will introduce important network concepts and measures using the Medici network for a real-world case study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\uparrow\\quad\\) is equivalent to \\(\\quad\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: If there are two arrows, one pointing at each individual, or a line with no arrowheads, then each member of the dyad may be either teacher or learner.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Florentine network, the edges are undirected, which makes sense since marriage takes two families and is therefore not directed. Note then we have no knowledge from which family came husband and wife. Note too that there could be multiple marriages between two families, but this information is not contained in this graph.\nIn an undirected graph, the neighborhood of an individual \\(i\\) (or family, organization, institution, or other social entity) can be written \\(n_i\\) and is a set of all the individuals who share an edge with \\(i\\). The set of the Medici’s network neighbors then is written mathematically as\n\\[\nn_{\\text{Medici}} = \\{\\text{Salviati},~\\text{Acciaiuol},~\\text{Barbadori},~\\text{Ridolfi},~\\text{Tornabuon},~\\text{Albizzi}\\}\n\\] The degree of node \\(i\\) is the number of neighbors it has, written \\(k_i\\), so \\(k_\\text{Medici} = 6\\).\n\ndata(\"florentine_m\")\n# Delete Pucci family (isolated)\nflorentine_m &lt;- delete_vertices(florentine_m, which(degree(florentine_m) == 0))\n\n# plot the graph\nset.seed(111)\nplot(florentine_m,\n  vertex.label.cex = .9,\n  vertex.size = 20,\n  vertex.label.color = \"black\",\n  vertex.color = \"white\",\n  vertex.frame.color = \"gray\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Florentine marriage network where edges represent marriages between families (node labels).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a bar plot of the degrees for each family:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe degree distribution is the fraction of nodes having degree \\(k\\), written \\(P(k)\\). Since the Medici family is the only one with a degree of six, and there are fifteen families, \\(P(6)=\\frac{1}{15}\\approx 0.066\\), which we can check like so:\n\ndegdist &lt;- degree_distribution(florentine_m)\nmedici_k &lt;- 6\n# Degree distribution starts at 0 and goes to maximum k; index 1, then\n# correlates to k=0 and need to add 1 to the Medici index.\ndegdist[[medici_k + 1]]\n\n[1] 0.06666667\n\n\nWe can plot a simple histogram representation of \\(P(k)\\) using base R like so\n\nbarplot(names=0:6, height=as.vector(degdist), ylab=\"Frequency\", xlab=\"Degree, k\", col=\"#69b3a2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConformity-biased learning\n\n\nSuccess-biased learning"
