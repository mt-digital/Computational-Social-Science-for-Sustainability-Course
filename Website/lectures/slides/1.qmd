## *Social Science for Sustainability*

- Elinor Ostrom led development of _social-ecological systems_ theory, which
identified _design principles_ to help sustain _common-pool resources_.
    - First woman to win a Nobel prize in economics (2009)

- A _common-pool resource_ is something like clean water or healthy forests;
  all the common-pool resources together are called the commons.

- Select *design principles* (8 total; see @Cox2010 reading for an overview):

    - Rules should fit local circumstances
    - Participation of _all_ stakeholders is vital
        - Management of the commons must be organized across social and
          institutional scales
        - All levels of social hierarchy must be recognized and free to organize
    - Conflict resolution should be easily accessible

Ostrom's work elevated traditional, Indigenous adaptations for a changing
climate (always been changing) and other sustainability challenges.

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

Two opportunities to complement Ostrom's socio-ecological systems program:

1. Complementary _deductive_ methods could predict the outcomes of
      candidate _interventions_ to promote sustainability.
    - Ostrom and colleagues developed the design principles _inductively_, based on
      decades of rigorous empirical research. 
2. Cooperation is not always necessary 
   in order to gain individual-level benefits and affect sustainability.
   - Walking, biking, or EVs instead of internal combustion engine commuting
   - Heat pumps and solar panels to reduce carbon-intensive energy generation

## Computational social _science_

- We use the scientific method, starting from the high school version:
    1. Hypothesize what causes some phenomenon 
    1. Gather evidence to support your explanation
    1. Evaluate the hypothesis (true, false, in-between)
    1. Repeat

- In computational social science we develop computer and mathematical models to 
  test hypotheses before gathering data.
- We can test some hypotheses deductively this way, or we can support hypotheses
  that motivate empirical studies.


# The Influencer: computational social science by example

## The Influencer

- Oftentimes people will eventually adopt a behavior if they observe an
"influencer". 
- If we are designing a sustainability _intervention_, we may 
want to know how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by an influencer
to adopt some behavior...

## The Influencer

Let's model how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by this influencer
to adopt the behavior of commuting on bike!

- A _vertice_ (dots) represents a person with a unique id
- An _edge_ (arrows) represents a relationship between two people
- Edge arrows indicate the direction of information flow
- Two simulated people interact if and only if an edge connects them

- In this model, everyone eventually bikes because there is no "forgetting" or
  "reverting" to previous behaviors.
- The state where all become bikers is called _fixation_.
- The time step $T$ when fixation occurs is the _fixation time_.
- With this model we can calculate $T$ as a function of the number of influenced
  agents, $N$, and the _transmissibility_ of biking, $\tau$.

# Review and next steps

## Review and next steps

Review

- Computational social science complements socio-ecological
  systems approaches to promote sustainability 
- Example _Influencer_ model to understand, e.g., how long an advertising
  campaign must run in order to affect all targeted individuals

Next steps:

- January: 
    - The effect of other social network configurations beyond influencer network, including group structure
    - Other assumptions about how learning works (add forgetting,
      "success-bias", and more)
- Beyond: 
    - Consider cooperative sustainable behaviors whose benefit depends on how
      many people adopt a behavior (e.g., prescriptive burns)
    - Understand and predict opinion polarization and its effect on
      sustainability

##  Wednesday 1/8: Introduce Problem Set 1

- Learn to analyze anonymized class demographic data
- Learn to program the Influencer model
- Problem Set #1 will be due January 29 at 11:30 AM before the start of class
<br><br>
- At future lectures and lab sections we will learn to program other models
that will be included in Problem Set #1.
