# Review: motivated by Ostrom's design principles for sustainable socio-economic systems

## Ostrom's design principles for sustainable socio-ecological systems

- Elinor Ostrom led development of _social-ecological systems_ theory, which
identified _design principles_ to sustainably manage _common-pool resources_ like clean water or healthy forests;
  all the common-pool resources together are called the commons.
  - First woman to win a Nobel prize in economics (2009)

- Select *design principles* (8 total; see @Cox2010 reading for an overview):

    - Rules should fit local circumstances
    - Participation of _all_ stakeholders is vital
        - Management of the commons must be organized across social and
          institutional scales
        - All levels of social hierarchy must be recognized and free to organize
    - Conflict resolution should be easily accessible

## Ostrom's work elevated Indigenous adaptation

Traditional, Indigenous adaptations for a changing
climate are often outperform alternative technological innovations [@Piggott-McKellar2020;@McNamara2020].

## Computational social science for sustainability    

- The design principles were _inferred_ from decades of studies by various authors
- Computation based on mechanistic models can provide _deductive_ predictions of  how _social phenomena_ emerge from social interactions
  - _Social phenomena_ such as...


## Plan for today

How useful practices propagate through populations

1. A general social model framework
1. Social learning strategies and models of cultural transmission
2. Social networks structure social learning: who learns from whom
3. The Legacy-Adaptive (LA) and Legacy-Adaptive-Legacy (LAL) models of diffusion via "contagion" 
  - Stochastic, deterministic, discrete, and continuous models
  
## Beyond today

1. More network constructions: small-world and scale-free networks
1. Success-biased social learning
1. How certain social networks may boost both innovation and inequality
1. Analysis of group structure and its effect on the diffusion of adaptations
1. Cooperation and coordination
1. Social influence and opinion dynamics: beliefs as particles


# The legacy-adaptive model

## Legacy-adaptive (LA) model 

- _Adapted_ from the susceptible-infected model of disease transmission, i.e., _contagion_
- 

## Why "legacy-adaptive"?

- "The legacy media want to destroy your right to freedom of speech" [says Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854925239693832576)
- Musk repurposed the phrase "legacy software", which indicates old, outdated software that will one day be abandoned
- It may be helpful to harness this phrase to the same effect as Musk does, but for non-adaptive behaviors with respect to climate change and sustainability
- It can be important to contest certain concepts like "legacy" to restrain others from defining how useful terms can be used

## The adaptation influencer case


- Oftentimes people will eventually adopt a behavior if they observe an
"influencer". 
- If we are designing a sustainability _intervention_, we may 
want to know how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by an influencer
to adopt some behavior



## The Influencer

Let's model how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by this influencer to adopt the behavior of commuting on bike!

- We specify the probability, $a$, that an influenced person starts biking
  when exposed to it by the influencer

- In this model, everyone eventually bikes because there is no "forgetting" or
  "reverting" to previous behaviors.
- The state where all become bikers is called _fixation_.
- The time step $T$ when fixation occurs is the _fixation time_.
- With this model we can calculate $T$ as a function of the number of influenced
  agents, $N$, and the _transmissibility_ of biking, $\tau$.

- Adapted from the susceptible-infected model from epidemiology: 
  - $L$ represents one of possibly several _legacy_ behaviors
  - $A$ represents the _adaptive_ behavior (biking in the influencer example)
  - These are analogous to an individual being _susceptible_ to disease or _infected_
- Adaptive behavior represented as a "contagion" that spreads from person to person with adoption probability, $a$
