## Overview: How to Write a Great Research Article 

- Writing a great research article is key to successful publication.
- Key stages: Structure, clarity, originality, addressing gaps in existing literature.
- This presentation will focus on the four key sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.


## Key components for a great Introduction

- Background context: Set the stage for the research.
- Problem statement: Identify the gap or question your research addresses.
- Literature review: Concisely summarize previous work and its limitations.
- Research aims/objectives: Clearly state the purpose and hypothesis.
- Significance: Why your study matters.

## Introduction rubric

1. **Context & Background** (1 point): Provides adequate background and sets context.
2. **Problem Statement** (1 point): Clear identification of the research gap.
3. **Literature Review** (1 point): Demonstrates awareness of existing research and its limitations.
4. **Research Objective(s)** (1 point): Clear and focused research question or hypothesis.
5. **Significance & Impact** (1 point): Clearly explains the importance of the research.


## "Methods" (or "Model") section

**Key Components:**
- Study design: Clearly describe the research design and rationale.
- Sampling: Detail the selection of participants or data sources.
- Data collection: Explain how data were gathered.
- Analysis methods: Describe the statistical or analytical methods used.

## 5-Point Rubric for the Methods Section

5. **Clarity** (1 point): Results are presented clearly and logically.


## Discussion section components

- Interpretation of findings: Discuss the significance and implications of the results.
- Compare with previous work: Relate findings to existing research.
- Limitations: Acknowledge study limitations and areas for future research.
- Conclusion: Provide a strong, concise conclusion.

## 5-Point Rubric for the Discussion Section

1. **Interpretation of Results** (1 point): Clear explanation of the significance of the findings.
2. **Comparison with Previous Work** (1 point): Relates findings to existing literature.
3. **Acknowledgment of Limitations** (1 point): Identifies study limitations and future research directions.
